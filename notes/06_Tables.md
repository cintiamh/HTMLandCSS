# Tables

## What's a table?

A table represents information in a grid format.

Each block in the grid is referred to as table cell.

## Basic Table structure

### `<table>`

The contents of the table are written row by row.

### `<tr>`

The Table row.

### `<td>`

The table cell (table data).

## Table headings

### `<th>`

`<th>` is used just like `<td>`, but represents the heading for either a column or a row.

Even if the cell has no content, you should always have a empty `<th>` or `<td>`.

#### `scope`

This attribute works with `<th>` element to indicate whether it is a heading for a colomn or a row.

Possible values: `row` or `col`.
