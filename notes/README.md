## Structure

In any kind of documents, structure is very important to help understanding the message and help to navigate around
the document.

### How pages use structure

Web pages try to mimic the traditional document types structure. For example, a newspaper and a insurance application
form look alike in paper and online.

### HTML describes the structure of pages

HTML elements - elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. You can have some information
between the opening and closing tags.

### HTML uses elements to describe the structure of pages

Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

### Attributes tell us more about elements

We can use attributes in the opening tag of the element. The attribute has an name and a value separated by "=".

The majority of attributes are for specific tags.

```html
<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English.</p>
```

### Body, Head and Title

#### `<body>`

Everything inside the body tag is shown inside the main browser page.

#### `<head>`

The head comes before body. The head contains information about the page.

#### `<title>`

The title can be found inside the head and its contents are shown in the top of the browser.
